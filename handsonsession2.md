# Hands-On Tutorial: Low-Code Quantum Application Development — From Visual Modeling to Execution


---

## Setup

This guide explains how to deploy the Quantum Low-Code Modeler using Docker and run a QAOA-based workflow.

All required components are provided as Docker containers and started using the supplied `docker-compose` file.

---

## 1. Prepare the Environment

Open the `docker` directory and update the `.env` file:

```
PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<your-public-ip>
```

Important: Use a publicly reachable IP address. Do not use `localhost`.

---

## 2. Start the Components

Run the following commands from the `docker` directory:

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --build
```

Wait until all containers are running. This may take several minutes.

---

## 3. Open the Modeler

Open the following URL:

http://localhost:4242

You should see the Modeler start screen:

The Modeler is pre-configured with:

- endpoints for the low-code backend  
- OpenTOSCA ecosystem workflow  
- QRM repository  

Open the Configuration menu in the toolbar and enter your OpenAI token.

---

## 4. Select an Algorithm

Open the Algorithm Selection view:

![Algorithm Selection](docs/graphics/Bild2.png)

Read the information provided:

![Notes](docs/graphics/Bild3.png)

Enter the following problem description:

```
I have five locations connected by roads. I want to split the locations into two groups so that as many roads as possible go between the groups.
```

![Problem Input](docs/graphics/Bild4.png)

Continue to the next step.

---

## 5. Inspect the Pattern Graph

Click on "Pattern Graph":

![Pattern Graph](docs/graphics/Bild5.png)

Scroll to review the listed components and information, then return using the Back button.

---

## 6. Select the Template

Click on "Select Template":

![Select Template](docs/graphics/Bild6.png)

Select the QAOA template.

This template is also available as `docs/model.json`.

---

## 7. Transform the Model

Click on "Transform Model":

![Transform](docs/graphics/Bild8.png)

A validation warning may appear:

![Warning](docs/graphics/Bild9.png)

This warning is expected. QAOA automatically adapts to the number of nodes, and the backend configures measurement of all qubits, so no manual specification is required.

---

## 8. Select and Deploy the Workflow

Select a workflow:

![Workflow](docs/graphics/Bild10.png)

Go to History. The top entry is the most recent transformation.

Click on Deploy:

![Deploy](docs/graphics/Bild11.png)

Deployment may take some time.

---

## 9. Execute the Workflow in Camunda

Open:

http://localhost:8090

Log in using the following credentials:

```
user: demo
password: demo
```

Open the Tasklist, select the process, and enter your IP address:

![Task Run](docs/graphics/Bild12.png)

Click Run.

---

## 10. View the Result

Open the Camunda Cockpit.

The result includes the objective function value. In this example, the value is:

```
5
```
